## Background

Leverage the convenience of libretro/retroarch to emulate the Z80 based home computers that the original ep128emu supports - that is, Enterprise 64/128, Videoton TVC, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum. Focus is on Enterprise and TVC.

The ep128emu core has been authored by:
- Istvan Varga (ep128emu)
- Zoltan Balogh (libretro core specific modifications)

The ep128emu core is licensed under [GPL2](https://github.com/libretro/ep128emu-core/blob/master/COPYING). A summary of the licenses behind RetroArch and its cores can be found [here](../development/licenses.md).

## Requirements

Since the emulated machines are 8-bit platforms from the 1980's, modern setups should have no problem emulating them. Tested on Raspberry Pi 2.

## Extensions

Content that can be loaded by the ep128emu core have the following file extensions:

- `.img` - Enterprise, CPC or TVC floppy disk image
- `.dsk` - Enterprise, CPC or TVC floppy disk image
- `.tap` - Enterprise or ZX Spectrum tape image
- `.dtf` - Enterprise compressed file
- `.cas` - Videoton TVC file format
- `.wav` - sound file interpreted as Enterprise tape
- `.tvcwav` - sound file interpreted as Videoton TVC tape
- `.cdt` - Amstrad CPC tape image
- `.tzx` - ZX Spectrum tape image
- `.bas`, `.com`, `.trn`, `.128`, `.` - common extensions for Enterprise executable files, including no extension

From version 1.1.0, emulator core is able to handle mono PCM WAV files with 1..8 bit depth as tape recordings. It is possible to enable libsndfile support during compilation, and then a wider range of formats are recognized, including MP3 if libsndfile version is at least 1.1. Using the `.wav` file extension will trigger the built-in RetroArch media player by default, it can be disabled under Settings / File Browser / Use Built-in Media Player. Rename `.wav` files to have `.tvcwav` extension to be interpreted as TVC tapes.

## Directories

The ep128emu core's library name is `ep128emu`. The ep128emu core saves/loads to/from these directories.

**Frontend's System directory**

| File         | Description |
|:------------:|:-----------:|
| ep128emu/rom/* |BIOS files are loaded from here |
| ep128emu/config/* |System-wide emulation configuration files |

## Geometry and timing

- The ep128emu core's core provided FPS is 50
- The ep128emu core's core provided sample rate is 44.1 kHz
- The ep128emu core's base width is 768
- The ep128emu core's base height is 288
- The ep128emu core's max width is 768
- The ep128emu core's max height is 576 (interlace mode)
- The ep128emu core's core provided aspect ratio is 4:3 (interlace mode)

The intelligent zoom function can reduce the apparent width/height, aspect ratio is also adjusted.

If there is LED driver configured in RetroArch, second LED should reflect disk activity state.

## Usage

Load any supported content file. Content type will be autodetected, and if possible, started. Content-specific [configuration file](https://github.com/libretro/ep128emu-core/blob/core/core/sample.ep128cfg) is also loaded if present. Without content, core starts with Enterprise 128 disk configuration.

In case of multi-disk (or multi-tape) games, use the Disk Control menu to add the subsequent images and switch between them. You can also use RetroArch's built-in memory analyzer to set up cheats.

Apart from disk/tape/fileIO differences, the core will adjust the emulated machine configuration in some cases:

- if content file has `.DTF` extension, ZozoTools BIOS will be used
- if content file name contains `[req brd-rom]`, German BIOS will be used
- if content file name contains `[req zrom]`, Hungarian language BIOS and EPDOS will be used
- if EP128_DISK_ISDOS (or EP64_DISK_ISDOS) type is supplied via configuration file, IS-DOS (CP/M flavor for Enterprise) will be used

## Core options

The ep128emu core has the following option(s) that can be tweaked from the core options menu. The default setting is bolded.
Settings with (Restart) means that core has to be closed for the new setting to be applied on next launch.

- Main thread wait (ms) (**0**|1|5|10) - forced sleep in main thread for lower CPU use
- High sound quality (**1**|0) - disable in case of performance problems
- Use accelerated SW framebuffer (**0**|1) - enable in case of performance problems (has some known bugs with interlace mode)
- Enable resolution changes (requires restart) (**1**|0)
- Border lines to keep when zooming in (**0**|2|4|8|10|20)
- System ROM version (EP only) (**Original**|Enhanced) - enhanced ROM contains faster memory test at startup
- User 1 Zoom button (**R3**|Start|Select|X|Y|A|B|L|R|L2|R2|L3)
- User 1 Info button (**L3**|R3|Start|Select|X|Y|A|B|L|R|L2|R2)
- User 1 Autofire for button (**None**|X|Y|A|B|L|R|L2|R2|L3|R3|Start|Select)
- User 1 Autofire repeat delay (**1**|2|4|8|16)

## Control device types

The emulated systems use several joystick types (all digital, with 1 fire button usually). Enterprise and TVC have a built-in joystick, and two external joystick connections. The ep128emu core supports device type changes in the controls menu. Change of the type updates the joypad and fire button mapping.

| Emulated machine | User 1 default joypad | User 2 default joypad | User 3 default joypad |
|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Enterprise | Internal | External 1 | External 2 |
| TVC | Internal | External 1 | External 2 |
| CPC | External 1 | External 2 |  |
| ZX | Kempston | Sinclair 1 | Sinclair 2 |

- Core default - Joypad and fire button is mapped as default (see above)
- Internal Joystick - Joypad and fire button is mapped for internal joystick on Enterprise and TVC. On CPC it is mapped to cursor keys.
- External Joystick 1 / Kempston - Joypad and fire button is mapped for external joystick 1 (Kempston interface in case of ZX)
- External Joystick 2 - Joypad and fire button is mapped for external joystick 2
- Sinclair Joystick 1 - Joypad and fire button is mapped for Sinclair joystick 1. Only useful for ZX. Joystick inputs are emulated as keys: 1 (left), 2 (right), 3 (down), 4 (up), 5 (fire).
- Sinclair Joystick 2 - Joypad and fire button is mapped for Sinclair joystick 2. Only useful for ZX. Joystick inputs are emulated as keys: 6 (left), 7 (right), 8 (down), 9 (up) ,0 (fire).
- Protek Joystick - Joypad and fire button is mapped for Protek/AGF joystick. Only useful for ZX. Joystick inputs are emulated as keys: 5 (left), 6 (down), 7 (up), 8 (right) ,0 (fire).
- External Joystick 3..6 - Joypad and fire button is mapped for external joystick 3..6. Only useful for Enterprise, very rarely used.

## Mouse

Mouse input is used for the EnterMice emulation of the Enterprise.

## Keyboard

### Enterprise 128

The ep128emu core takes the Enterprise UK keyboard as a basis:
![](../image/core/ep128emu/enterprise-128-uk-keyboard.png)

Most mappings are straightforward positionally from an ISO UK keyboard:

- Dark green: natural mapping, both position and function matches nicely
- Light green: either position or function is slightly different
- Yellow: function is different
- Red: extra mapping
- Dark grey: keys intentionally reserved for RetroArch / OS functions

![](../image/core/ep128emu/iso-mapping-for-enterprise-128.png)

Exceptions are marked in the following table:

| RetroKeyboard Inputs         | Enterprise keyboard input |

### Videoton TVC

The Videoton TVC has a layout that is somewhat similar to ISO Hungarian layout:
![](../image/core/ep128emu/videoton-tvc-keyboard.png)
![](../image/core/ep128emu/iso-mapping-for-videoton-tvc.png)

Since TVC has several extra keys, but no function keys, F-row is used as replacement for those.

## BIOS

Following "BIOS" files are used for emulation. Note: in usual 8-bit home computer terms, these are "ROM"s as they contain the original machine's read-only memory dumps.

From ep128emu_core version 1.1.0, external BIOS files are optional.

## Special emulation

Enterprise 128 has software extensions to emulate ZX Spectrum (48, 128) and Amstrad CPC. As a technical quirk, these emulators can be run in the ep128emu-core, creating a double emulation layer.

### SPEMU

- Obtain ROM version of SPEmu from the [EnterpriseForever forums](https://enterpriseforever.com/letoltesek-downloads/enterprise-software/).
- Place ROM files under RetroArch system directory: `system/ep128emu/roms/`
- Create a custom config file next to the content (such as a .tzx file) called `enterprise.ep128cfg`:

    `machineDetailedType "EP128_TAPE"`
    `memory.ram.size 256`
    `memory.rom.40.file "spemu128.rom"`
    `memory.rom.40.offset 0`
    `memory.rom.41.file "spemu128.rom"`
    `memory.rom.41.offset 16384`
    `memory.rom.42.file "spemu128.rom"`
    `memory.rom.42.offset 32768`
    `tape.forceMotorOn Yes`

- Start ep128emu core using the tape content
- Invoke the SPEmu extension with `:sp128`
- Choose Load tape

### CPCEMU

- Obtain COM version of CPCEmu from the [EnterpriseForever forums](https://enterpriseforever.com/letoltesek-downloads/enterprise-software/).
- Start CPCEMU.COM the usual way (select the file in RetroArch and open it with ep128emu core)
- Once the blue screen has loaded, open quick menu (F1) go to Disk Control and select the file that needs to be loaded
- Continue, enable keyboard pass-through with Scroll Lock, and issue RUN command as needed
- It may be needed to change the control type to External 2 in Quick Menu / Controls
