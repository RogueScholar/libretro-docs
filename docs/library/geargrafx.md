Required or optional firmware files go in RetroArch's system directory.

!!! attention
	 Any CD-ROM System BIOS will work, but some are known to be incompatible with certain games.

!!! attention
	 You can choose the BIOS to use in the core options menu.

## Core options

The Geargrafx core has the following options that can be tweaked from the core options menu. The default setting is bolded.

Settings with (restart) means that core has to be closed for the new setting to be applied on next launch.

- **System (restart)** [geargrafx_console_type] (**Auto**|PC Engine (JAP)|SuperGrafx (JAP)|TurboGrafx-16 (USA))

    Select the console type to emulate. The default setting, Auto, automatically detects the appropriate console type based on the loaded content.
    Many US games will not start if a Japanese system is detected.

- **Aspect Ratio** [geargrafx_aspect_ratio] (**1:1 PAR**|4:3 DAR|6:5 DAR|16:9 DAR|16:10 DAR)

    Select which aspect ratio will be presented by the core.

    - *1:1 PAR* selects an aspect ratio that produces square pixels.
    - *4:3 DAR* forces 4:3 aspect ratio.
    - *6:5 DAR* forces 6:5 aspect ratio.
    - *16:9 DAR* forces 16:9 aspect ratio.
    - *16:10 DAR* forces 16:10 aspect ratio.

- **Overscan** [geargrafx_overscan] (**Disabled**|Enabled)

    This option enables/disables overscan (borders). Overscan width is dependent on the content.

- **Scanline Count** [geargrafx_scanline_count] (**224p**|240p|Manual)

    Select which scanline count will be used in emulation.

    - *224p* forces 224 scanlines.
    - *240p* forces 240 scanlines.
    - *Manual* lets you set the first and last scanline manually.

- **Scanline Start (Manual)** [geargrafx_scanline_start] (**3**|values from 0 to 30)

    This option will set the first scanline to be displayed. Scanline 0 is the first visible scanline.
    This option is only available when 'Scanline Count' is set to 'Manual'.

- **Scanline End (Manual)** [geargrafx_scanline_end] (**241**|values from 220 to 241)

    This option will set the last scanline to be displayed. Scanline 241 is the last visible scanline.
    This option is only available when 'Scanline Count' is set to 'Manual'.

- **Composite Colors** [geargrafx_composite_colors] (**Disabled**|Enabled)

    If enabled, the core will use composite colors instead of RGB colors.

- **No Sprite Limit** [geargrafx_no_sprite_limit] (**Disabled**|Enabled)

    Enabling this option removes the per-line sprite limit, but may cause glitches in certain games.
    It's best to keep this core option disabled.

- **Backup RAM (restart)** [geargrafx_backup_ram] (**Enabled**|Disabled)

    This option allows you to disable backup RAM (not recommended).

- **CD-ROM (restart)** [geargrafx_cdrom_type] (**Auto**|Standard|Super CD-ROM|Arcade CD-ROM)

    Choose the type of CD-ROM system to emulate. The Auto setting automatically selects the appropriate CD-ROM type based on the loaded content.

- **CD-ROM Bios (restart)** [geargrafx_cdrom_bios] (**Auto**|System Card 1|System Card 2|System Card 3|Game Express)

    Specify the BIOS file to use for CD-ROM emulation. The *Auto* setting automatically selects the appropriate BIOS based on the loaded content. You can also manually choose one for compatibility with specific games.

- **Preload CD-ROM (restart)** [geargrafx_cdrom_preload] (**Disabled**|Enabled)

    This option will preload all CD-ROM tracks in RAM. It will increase the memory usage of the core, but may improve performance.

- **PSG Volume** [geargrafx_psg_volume] (**100**|0 - 200)

    This option sets the volume of the PSG sound system, which is used for sound effects and music in many games.
    The value is a percentage from 0 to 200, where 100 is the default volume.

- **CD-ROM Volume** [geargrafx_cdrom_volume] (**100**|0 - 200)

    This option sets the volume of the CD-ROM sound system, which is used for music in CD-ROM games.
    The value is a percentage from 0 to 200, where 100 is the default volume.

- **ADPCM Volume** [geargrafx_adpcm_volume] (**100**|0 - 200)

    This option sets the volume of the ADPCM sound system, which is typically used for speech in CD-ROM games.
    The value is a percentage from 0 to 200, where 100 is the default volume.

- **Allow Up+Down / Left+Right** [geargrafx_up_down_allowed] (**Disabled**|Enabled)

    Enabling this option allows pressing, quickly alternating, or holding both left and right (or up and down in some games) directions at the same time.
    This may cause movement based glitches to occur in certain games.
    It's best to keep this core option disabled.

- **Allow Soft Reset** [geargrafx_soft_reset] (**Enabled**|Disabled)

    Pressing RUN and SELECT simultaneously on the PCE gamepad will SOFT RESET the console. This is the default hardware behavior.
    Disable this option if you want the soft reset functionality turned off.

- **TurboTap** [geargrafx_turbotap] (**Disabled**|Enabled)

    This option enables/disables TurboTap support (up to 5 players).

- **Avenue Pad 3 Switch** [geargrafx_avenue_pad_3_switch] (**Auto**|SELECT|RUN)

    When using the Avenue Pad 3 controller, you can set the switch to either *RUN* or *SELECT* with this option.
    If you choose *Auto*, the emulator will select the best option based on the game being played.
