# Sega - MS/GG/MD/CD (Genesis Plus GX)

## Background

Genesis Plus GX is an open-source Sega 8/16 bit emulator developed by Eke-Eke which focuses on accuracy and portability. The source code, originally based on Genesis Plus 1.3 by Charles MacDonald, has been heavily modified & enhanced, with respect to initial goals and design, in order to improve the accuracy of emulation, implementing new [features](https://github.com/ekeeke/Genesis-Plus-GX/blob/master/wiki/Features.md) and adding support for [extra peripherals](https://github.com/ekeeke/Genesis-Plus-GX/blob/master/wiki/Features.md#support-for-various-peripherals), [cartridge & systems hardware](https://github.com/ekeeke/Genesis-Plus-GX/blob/master/wiki/Features.md#support-for-various-cartridges-extra-hardware) such as various lightguns, the FM Sound Unit and Lock-On cartridge technology.

Genesis Plus GX has [100% compatibility](https://github.com/ekeeke/Genesis-Plus-GX/blob/master/wiki/Compatibility.md) with Genesis / Mega Drive, Sega/Mega CD, Master System, Game Gear, SG-1000 & Pico released software (including all unlicensed or pirate known dumps), also emulating backwards compatibility modes when available. 

**Keep in mind that [32X games](https://segaretro.org/Sega_32X#List_of_games) are not supported.**

## Loading Sega CD games
When loading Sega CD games, Genesis Plus GX needs a cue-sheet that points to an image file. A cue sheet, or cue file, is a metadata file which describes how the tracks of a CD or DVD are laid out.

If you have e.g. `foo.bin`, you should create a text file and save it as `foo.cue`. If the Sega CD game is single-track, the cue file contents should look like this:

```
 FILE "foo.bin" BINARY
  TRACK 01 MODE1/2352
   INDEX 01 00:00:00
```

After that, you can load the `foo.cue` file in RetroArch with the Genesis Plus GX core.

!!! warning ""
    Certain Sega CD games are multi-track, so their .cue files might be more complicated.

Here's a cue file example done with Lunar - Eternal Blue (USA)

![](../image/core/genesis_plus_gx/cue.png)

!!! warning ""
	For Sega-CD games, ISO + WAV, BIN + CUE and ISO + OGG formats are supported; ISO + MP3 is not supported. Audio files must be in the 16-bit stereo 44100Hz format. If using a cue sheet, WAV or OGG tracks should be denoted as AUDIO.

When loading ISO + WAV or ISO + OGG format games, the core will attempt to load a cue named the same as the iso first. If one is not found, the following audio track naming formats are accepted for a data track of "game.iso":

- game02.ogg
- game 02.ogg
- game-02.ogg
- game - 02.ogg
- game_02.ogg

### Loading Multiple Disk games

If foo is a multiple-disk Sega CD game, you should have .cue files for each one, e.g. `foo (Disc 1).cue`, `foo (Disc 2).cue`, `foo (Disc 3).cue`.

To take advantage of Genesis Plus GX's Disk Control feature for disk swapping, an index file (a m3u file) should be made.

Create a text file and save it as `foo.m3u`. Then enter your game's .cue files on it. The m3u file contents should look something like this:

`foo.m3u`
```
foo (Disc 1).cue
foo (Disc 2).cue
foo (Disc 3).cue
```

After that, you can load the `foo.m3u` file in RetroArch with the Genesis Plus GX core.

Here's a m3u example done with the Sega CD 32x version of Night Trap

![](../image/core/genesis_plus_gx/m3u.png)

!!! attention
	Adding multi-track games to a RetroArch playlist is recommended. (Manually add an entry a playlist that points to `foo.m3u`)

### Swapping Disks

Disks can be swapped through Quick Menu -> Disk Control in RetroArch.

If not using .m3u files, .cue files must be manually selected via the Load New Disk legacy feature.

If using .m3u files, disks can be swapped by selecting Eject Disk, changing the Current Disk Index to your desired disk, and finally selecting Insert Disk.

### CHD

Alternatively to using cue sheets with .bin/.iso files, you can convert your Sega CD games to .chd (MAME Compressed Hunks of Data) to reduce file sizes and neaten up your game folder.

To convert content to CHD format, use the chdman tool found inside the latest MAME distribution and point it to a .cue file, like so:

```
chdman createcd --input foo.cue --output foo.chd
```

!!! attention
	For multi-disc content, make an .m3u file that lists all the .chd files instead of .cue files (content must be added to playlists manually).

## Playing with MD+ / MSU-MD modes

Comparable to how MSU-1 modifcations can enhance SNES games; Mega Drive Plus / Genesis Plus (MD+) and MSU-MD (Mega SD flash cartridge) patches can be used to add CD quality level of audio to certain Sega Genesis and Mega Drive games via the emulated Sega CD hardware and its CDDA track functionality.

Regarding Genesis Plus GX's implementation of MD+ mode operation, all CD overlay commands (incl. cue loop commands) described in MegaSD dev manual (see referenced PDF at the end of this section) are supported except the ones that deal with opening/reading files from SD card (starting from command 1Ch) but afaik no MD+ hacks use these commands so far.

Since there is no way to auto-detect a MD+ patched ROM, MegaSD add-on emulation needs to be enabled in core options (through the newly added "CD add-on" core option). However, when "CD add-on" core option is set to Auto, if a cue file with same basename as loaded ROM file is found in same directory AND that cue file contains MegaSD specific keywords ("REM LOOP xxx", "REM NOLOOP",...), MegaSD CD overlay emulation will be automatically enabled (instead of full Sega/Mega CD hardware emulation).

By setting the "CD add-on" core option to "Sega/Mega CD", you can force Sega/Mega CD hardware emulation when any MD game (<8MB) is loaded even if there is no cue file found in loaded game directory (this can be useful for demos or homebrew games that want to use Mega CD extra hardware without necessarily having a loaded CD beforehand).

And by setting the "CD add-on" option to "None", Sega/Mega CD hardware emulation will be forced disabled, even if a cue file is found in loaded game directory or when the loaded game is known to have Sega/Mega CD support (like Pier Solar, Flux or Wonder Library). This emulates the behavior where there is no Sega/Mega CD unit attached.

Although no known games are using them, MegaSD extended SSF2 mapper and limited ROM write mapper (automatically enabled when respectively "SEGA SSF2" and "SEGA MEGASD" are found in loaded ROM header) are also emulated, according to the description in MegaSD dev manual. Note that MegaSD overlay will also automatically be enabled when these mappers are detected, no matter of the "CD Add-on" core option.

Please peruse the official MegaSD manual for further information: https://downloads.terraonion.com/public/MegaSD_DEV_Manual.pdf

Also, there's an useful reference wiki here for MSU-MD games/patches and its technical specifications here: https://arcadetv.github.io/msu-md-patches/

!!! attention
	Make sure that your files match what's specified in your MD+/MSU-MD cue file!

## Core options

The Genesis Plus GX core has the following options that can be tweaked from your frontend's core options menu or manually changed via core configuration files. Options are listed below in the following format:

Option Name [option_key] 

(setting1/setting2/...)

To manually change an option, search for that option's key in the core configuration file you want to edit and set it to your desired setting value, enclosed in quotations. For example, if you had set the CD-DA Volume to 50% and wanted to revert it to 100%, you would change genesis_plus_gx_cdda_volume = "50" to genesis_plus_gx_cdda_volume = "100". Manually editing core configuration files is typically unnecessary unless your frontend does not have a method for toggling options.

The default setting for each option will be highlighted in **bold**. Settings with (Restart) means that core has to be shut down for the new setting to be applied on next launch.

### System

Configure base hardware selection / region / BIOS / Sega CD save file parameters.

**Interlaced Mode 2 Output** [genesis_plus_gx_render]

Interlaced Mode 2 allows the Mega Drive/Genesis to output a double height (high resolution) 320x448 image by drawing alternate scanlines each frame (this is used by 'Sonic the Hedgehog 2' and 'Combat Cars' multiplayer modes). 'Single Field' mimics original hardware, producing each field (320x224) alternatively with flickering/interlacing artefacts. 'Double Field' simulates the interlaced display, which stabilises the image but causes mild blurring.

* **Single Field** [single field] - Sets Interlaced Mode 2 Output as Single Field.
* Double Field [double field] - Sets Interlaced Mode 2 Output as Double Field.

**Frameskip** [genesis_plus_gx_frameskip]

Skip frames to avoid audio buffer under-run (crackling). Improves performance at the expense of visual smoothness. 'Auto' skips frames when advised by the frontend. 'Manual' utilises the 'Frameskip Threshold (%)' setting.

* **Off [disabled]** - Disables frameskip.
* Auto [auto] - Automatically skips frames to avoid audio crackling.
* Manual [manual] - Allows the user to utilises the 'Frameskip Threshold' core option's set percentage to manually adjust frameskip.

**Frameskip Threshold (%)** [genesis_plus_gx_frameskip_threshold]

When the 'Frameskip' core option is set to 'Manual', specifies the audio buffer occupancy threshold (percentage) below which frames will be skipped. Higher values reduce the risk of crackling by causing frames to be dropped more frequently.

: 15% to 60% in increments of 3%, **33% is default**.
